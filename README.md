This night lamp can be operated alone, but also can be extended by other modules and tags:

* Encoder Module can be added to the Night Lamp to control the intensity of lamp
* Button Module can be added so you don't have to press tiny button on the Core Module
* Button Module can be paired and control the lamp
* Motion Detector can be paired with Night Lamp and turn the lamp on for amount of time
* Lux Meter Tag can be added to the Night Lamp so the Motion Detector turn the LED on only when is dark in the room

# Pairing:

1. Use HARDWARIO Playground and flash other Core Module with Radio Button or Radio Motion Detector
2. Power on the Night Lamp, pres the button for 3 seconds - the LED Strip turnes RED and LED blinks on Core Module
3. Remove USB or batteries, wait 5 seconds and connect batteries to the Button or Motion detector
4. After pairing one module, the red color turns off. Repeat step 2 for adding more devices

# Clear paired nodes

2. Immediatelly after connecting the power press and hold the button. You have to do it at least 200ms after power-up. Don't press button together with power-up.
3. The modules are unpaired
